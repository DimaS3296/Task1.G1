onflicts generally arise when two people have changed the same lines in a file, or if one developer deleted a file while another developer was modifying it. In these cases, Git cannot automatically determine what is correct. Conflicts only affect the developer conducting the merge, the rest of the team is unaware of the conflict. Git will mark the file as being conflicted and halt the merging process. It is then the developers' responsibility to resolve the conflict.

#### To resolve a conflict: 

1. The most direct way to resolve a merge conflict is to edit the conflicted file.

In addition to the Git, many third-party tools offer streamlined merge conflict support features.
