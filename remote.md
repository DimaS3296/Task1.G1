## git remote 

**git remote *[file]*** - To connect a local repository with a remote repository. A remote repository can have a name set to avoid having to remember the URL of the repository.
The connections here are not like direct links into other repositories, but as bookmarks that serve as convenient names to be used as a reference. 
A remote repository can have any name. It’s common practice to name the remote repository ‘origin’.

Use command:
```bash=
git remote.
```


Usage:

### Add remote repository
$ git remote <_command_> <remote_name> <remote_URL>

### List named remote repositories
$ git remote -v
