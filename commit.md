## git commit

**git commit *[file]*** - Record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference, each commit has a unique ID. The commit command makes sure that the changes are saved to the local repository.

Use command:
```bash=
git commit.
```

It’s best practice to include a message with each commit. The command **git commit –m *[message]***  allows you to describe everyone and help them understand what has happened.

Use command:
```bash=
git commit -m.
```
